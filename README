HACKING GUIDE
arch          Disassemblers for different architectures, and arch-common code
gui/curses    old curses gui [deprecated]
gui/qt        new QT gui [not yet in existence]
idis          common code

PLAN - stabilize / cleanup disassembler + code system, write importer to bring database from old version to new
     - write QT gui awesomeness; maybe bring in some bits / concepts from dismember?
